# 來 Quote 冊

[來 Quote 冊](https://zcwu.site) is a book recommendation platform designed to share reading experiences through user interactions. It tackles the issue where traditional online bookstores focus on sales-driven recommendations, while social media-based book clubs often struggle with fragmented attention.

## Features

- Enabled users to like, collect, add comments, and share quotes for books, providing an exceptional user experience
- Featured a book display section, where the most recently liked and collected books are displayed in order of time
- Introducing a comment section, where the latest comments and quotes are displayed in time sequence
- Users can view detailed information about books by selecting content of interest from the latest interactions mentioned above.
- On the detailed book page, there are two user flows:
    - Users who have read the book can like it, leave comments, or share quotes
    - Users who haven't read the book can add it to their 'to-read' list and check for library availability
- Users can edit or delete their comments and quotes in real-time after posting, providing a seamless experience
- Users can view and manage all their interactions on the platform through the personal bookshelf, including liked books, books added to the 'to-read' list, and published comments
